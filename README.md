Photos and Text: The next generation
=====================================

A redesign of my website to expand its scope. The original site was designed to handle just select photos. This new version will be designed to handle galleries of images as well as text articles (maybe). Most of the site will be handled by straight flask, with the gallery edit pages using Angular connected to a REST API.
