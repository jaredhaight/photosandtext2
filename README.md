Photos and Text: The next generation
=====================================

A redesign of my website to expand its scope. The original site was designed to handle just select photos. This new version will be designed to handle galleries of images as well as text articles. Originally I was going to write this as a REST API backend feeding to Angular. This was over complicated for my needs and wasn't a whole lot of fun to play with. The plan now is to do the whole thing with Flask.

Eventually I'd like to include an API so I can tie in automated photo uploads from my computers and other devices.
