Photos and Text: The next generation
=====================================

Two years later, I've decided to re-write my first real website. I've learned a lot in the last couple of years and I'm hoping that the end result here will be a cleaner and more powerful website.

The idea is to design it as a separate backend and frontend. The backend will be a REST API powered by Flask-Restful while the frontend for the site will be writen in Angular. Eventually I'd like to write a service that will run on my computers and regularly add photos to the site by monitoring folders or something.
